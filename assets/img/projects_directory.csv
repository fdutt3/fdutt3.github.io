The competition guidelines expected us to provide a futuristic riverfront development proposal utilising sustainable and eco-friendly design strategies. We  proposed a green masterplan which focuses on replenishing lost urban green space owing  to rampant construction and environmental waste. <br><br>

The program of the masterplan comprises of premium office towers, mid-rise studio apartments, high-end residential apartments along with commercial retail streets and shopping malls. Adding to these, our design proposal addressess how the green fabric of the city can be revitalised and improvised. We proposed to construct high-rise buildings with lower built foot print that minimizes ground cover dilapidation. The precious ground area can be used as green gardens. Also, vertically  we allowed scooping pockets of built spaces and replacing with sky gardens, which further enhances the concept of eco green city in the middle of a metropolis like Shanghai. In the 21st century where technology almost commands every aspect of life, we let technology also control the urban fabric and the quality of the built envrionment. Thereby, the proposal for the masterplan, exemplified the use of green algae as a means to reproduce solar energy upon reaction with sunlight. These green algae facade panels were embedded on to the building facade systems.

The station was expected to accomodate two platforms of size 60m each. We studied the hot and dry climate of Rajasthan. We designed the station shed, with an efficient structural system capable to handle violent sandstorms, a frequently occuring natural phenomena in the desert climate of the site. As the design was amid sand dunes, we formulated the concept from the genesis of sand dunes. The sheds' form was driven by aerodynamic factors of the wind. Rain water harvesting methods were deployed to address water scarcity. The rain water harvesting tank also helped in cooling the station.  Efficient ventillation was proposed by the placement of computer controlled vents on the glass roof. Station waiting areas and cafes were placed underground to reduce solar heating  due to the hot and dry weather. <br><br>

First time ever separate transportation of luggages & passengers were provided. Separate conveyor belt & freight elevator system helped this process. Roof vents on the main shed added day lighting & helped transfer hot air out & cool air inside. The floor slabs were supported with regular perforated cellular beams, with fire insulation. These perforations saved material & rendered the structure light. They rested on articulated lattice portal structure spanning 30m over the platforms.

In this proposal we provide a design concept for the middle school, while a high school is provided as a concept schematic, that will follow similar design guidelines. Our design is principally based on three main concepts further described below: <br><br>

Spatial variety: Different people learn in different conditions. Conventional learning spaces are too rigid and fixed which misses the flexibility needed to allow for conducive conditions that can encourage students to learn new knowledge in their most comfortable space. In this design, we ensure that we provide a diverse array of spaces that can accommodate the varied needs of students. In addition, we provide flexible semi-open (with nature) spaces that encourage students to collaborate and invent to make new technology, new design or new art. Every space is both digitally and physically connected using means such as large displays, drones, touch screen surface displays etc.  <br><br>

Connectedness: The second concept of this design is inside out connectedness to the city and the neighboring urban fabric. We think education is not only for enrolled students but also for the larger community of which the school is a distinct participant. The design of the school invites people to participate in the learning process by creating public spaces such as public library, exhibition galleries, AR-VR Tech Media Tower that may exhibit students work. These spaces can provide specially designed classes to people in diverse topics such as AI, mobile technology, nanotechnology, calligraphy etc.  <br><br>
 
Eco-adaptable: While our design looks into the future with the state of the art technology, it embraces the historical learnings humans have learned. In that spirit, while the shape and form of the design is unconventional and futuristic, the building materials are eco friendly, sustainable and eco-adaptable. We use stone, wood, and eco-friendly glazings'. In addition, we minimize the glazed area to guard against direct glaring sunlight that minimizes the energy cost of the building.

The design encourages safe and responsible social distancing but at the same time provides ample opportunity to close friends or families (living in the same house or apartment) to sit and stay closer in a public space. Each Pod is a semi covered seating of dimension 1400 mm by 1400 mm (height 1500 mm) allowing upto two adults to sit together in the same Pod. In addition, these units are movable, meaning users can rotate their orientation to face to or away from another Pod (person sitting next to them). These Pods are installed on a metal channel or track, on which these can be further pushed around to reposition their location. This is designed to allow people to keep separation with one another or stay close to their family members. The track ensures the public seating is not vandalized or stolen, or not misplaced, creating clutter in the city. <br><br>

Pods are built with sustainable galvanized steel as a single pivoting structural post. The covering of the Pod can either be built with wood or 3D printed ceramics with customized colors. These colored units can add diversity and positivity to any public space where they are placed. Besides, the surfacing is designed to be smooth and self-cleaning without any nooks and cranny, thus removing the need to frequently clean these units. <br><br>

Furthermore, these units can be solar powered and can be equipped with USB chargers with bluetooth connections to allow users to sit and work for longer durations. Each Pod unit comes with storage spaces that may allow parents (can store baby changing equipments) and workers (can store laptop bags) to sit comfortably with peace.

Air pollution in Asia is a problem that needs immediate human intervention. As a case study site, the city of Beijing in China is chosen where air pollution level is so high that at least one third of the countrys' population gets badly effected causing as many as 1.6 million peoples' death. According to Greenpeace, China's air pollution puts public health at risk every day because of the presence of minuscule particles known as PM2.5. These are more prone to carrying a variety of toxic heavy metals, acid oxides, organic pollutants, and other chemicals, as well as micro-organisms such as bacteria and viruses in the air. The proposed high rise  tower 'E- PURIFY' is a step towards making a better tomorrow by not only manifesting the building as an urban air cleaning agent but also as a way to bring human beings closer to nature by imbibing healthier and sustainable lifestyle. <br><br>

ENVIRONMENT <br><br>
Pollution control : The proposed high rise structure is designed as a twin tower, connected on the top as an iconic gateway forming a landmark impression to the visitor, thereby attracting more people to the site. The 698m tower is wrapped with a porous screen facade screen (225 000 sq m area) built with Titanium Dioxide. As air interacts with it, UV-light-activated free radicals destroy any existing pollutants cleaning the neighboring air substantially. The form of the tower is aerodynamically designed to aid flow of air on the tower to maximize volume of air cleaned per day. The exterior walls of the facade are angled inside to minimize wind load on the tower. The porosity of the screen is higher on the lower levels of the tower and lower on the upper levels of the tower to optimize adequate interior daylighting. A vertical green park is provided which aids cleaning the air further by removing a large amount of carbon and dust particles from the environment. In addition, this green cover adds oxygen, provides acoustic buffer and reduces urban heat island effect. The tower is built from cross laminated timber, an engineered wood consisting of multiple timber sections along with reinforced steel. This reduces the embodied energy use in the project by 70-80%. Also as timber is recyclable, the lost timber from trees can be regrown. Timber construction speeds up the construction time manifolds and provides a much refined high quality spatial experience.<br><br>

Energy Production: The vertical green park has over 20000 sq.m. size of algae photo bio reactors which interacts with the sun rays and the carbon dioxide from the environment. The resulting biomass is burnt to provide electricity and heat to the tower. While conventionally PV cells are used to provide energy, the process to manufacture these cells is expensive and is extremely polluting to the nature.  The technology embedded on the vertical green park, collects light and uses it to grow Algae within the bio reactors. The grown algae is taken to a combustion chamber to form biomass which is then converted to electricity or heat. The upper levels of the tower also relies on wind turbines to generate energy.<br><br>

CONTEXT AND USE<br><br>
The proposed development is approx. 1 million sq.m. size entertainment district positioned, very close to Sanlitun area in Beijing which is widely popular for recreational uses. The towers' predominant uses are restaurants, retails, shopping areas, exhibition galleries, luxury hotels and health resorts. Other uses include creative offices for entertainment industry including artists' studio and maker spaces. Considering the close proximity of the site to the  bustling Sanlitun district, newly built Phoenix Media Center, Chaoyang park and the Chaoyang Park Plaza, it will get the much needed footfall for an extended vertical recreational district which stays active 18 hours of the day. One of the innovative functions of the tower is a vertical green park, which is a space to hang out with friends, walk your dog, workout, yoga, play with animals or birds, grow your own vegetables and learn about nature. Essentially, it brings people closer to the nature and increases bio diversity in the city.<br><br>

The site given was at the scenic and famous  Suqian city's Luoma lake in  in Jiangsu, China. Originally tourists needed to walk or explore the vast area of the surrounding area of the lake by foot, boat, circulators etc. Hotel/ hospitality services close to the park often endanger biodiversity and essence of the nature to support peoples' tourism needs.  Our idea was a fusion of improved e-commerce and hospitality services.  We proposed PODISTLE - I , mobile pods/tents that would blend with the natural surrounding, and  have mobility within a defined natural precincts. Guests could hire these mobile pods on hourly, daily or even monthly basis. All services (like food, water, dry cleaning etc.) could be delivered  to the pods through e-commerce services that would allow guests to live and explore nature at any time of the day without worrying about their daily chores. The design of the pods was kept minimal (starting from a sphere geometry, minimal volume/ area) to allow visitors to enjoy the natural surrounding at its best. The pod was envisioned to allow visitors to access land and water bodies within public precincts. <br><br>

Guests could carry Podistle around the lake, to enjoy the pristine beautiful nature and at the same time, experience diverse views/sites near the lake. The lake had many nodes around it, given its strategic location, for example, the Zhangshan Forest Park, Yanghetian Ecological Garden, Yaowan Ancient Town etc. This provided an oppportunity for many pod stations which can allow people to board the pod and spend time on the lake and visit all the adjoining locations. Its a new hotel business model where site seeing and staying was facilitated at the same time. <br><br>

The design was equipped with a 8000 sqft area of photovoltaic sheet, which was strategically oriented to maximise solar gain and generate energy. It had controllable vertical rust resistant metal fins, allowing variable shading to augment diffused daylighting to the interior. Many Podistile together, created a smart network with shared cloud-based infrastructure to faciliate hassle-free interaction and communication between guests. They were augmented with mobile and desktop apps encouraging users to interact and mingle with their neighbors on the lake.",,architecture,mobile pods

The ground floor accomodates banquet halls, coffee shops, restaurants, shopping arena and old age compact quarters. <br><br>

Energy Conservation methods used include trombe wall, low e-glazing, sustainable wood, planters and roof terracing, louvers & light sheves. The towers are placed on the Ninghai mountain next to an artificial lake and designed keeping the sun path in mind. Thereby the facade/skin  of the tower is subdivided into north and south facade, and respective treatment is provided to protect the interior spaces. For example, the south side facade reflects horizontal louver and aluminium light shelf system to reflect light deep inside.The north facade comprises of clear glass along with a projected balcony. The railing of the balcony lowers down to a planter box on the south facade to screen the direct summer sun light.  A 12 inch thick trombe wall system is located on the south west location, thereby tapping maximum winter heat  during day, which could be used for  energy generation for the tower. The trombe wall also contains a horizontal shading cover for  high angle summer sun, when excessive heat is not needed.

In this design challenge, we were motivated to educate and spread awareness of the dire seriousness of this problem and the need to create a change; a change where each one of us 'can' and 'need' to contribute. <br><br>

POST Houston, the Houston's Theatre District, offers a brilliant opportunity for people to convene and connect in its new cultural and commercial hub in downtown Houston. This space is expected to be an inspiring platform for people to meet for various activities such as recreation, cultural events, business meetups, 'do it yourself' activities, discussions, and demos, etc. Such a setting provides an excellent opportunity to convey to a large audience the change our planet is going through by showing visual narratives that can spread awareness and knowledge. We present ACT-ON, a graphic design theme laid on  eight monolithic steel furniture masses, that are part of a Superfurniture series. These graphic boards are carefully designed to visually show a scenario that posits, how the current world may look like in the near future, or how we may participate in preventing further harm to the environment. In this design scheme, we show a few Graphic Illustrations as representative samples that can be laid on these Superfurnitures. These graphic boards may have different tilings on the furniture based on its shape, configuration, and size. The boards can be mixed together to use on a piece of single furniture, as shown in the renderings.

However, to address the diverse needs of people and to serve the ever-growing urban population, Handans' spatial complexity grows. This renders its urban spaces difficult for people to keep track of, and navigate without any external aid such as Baidu or Bing maps, etc. This problem becomes even more serious, (1) when someone new is visiting the city, (2) for older adults or children or (3) even for regular people who go to see new places. One of the major outcomes of cities' rapid growth is that people struggle to find ways to their desired destination. Another common problem that people face is the inability to interact and collaborate with others. Often people are engaged with their mobile devices or spend time alone. Public interaction and exchange of ideas caters to the healthy growth of the citizens of a city, which, unfortunately, is missing as we modernize human civilization.  <br><br>

To solve these urban problems, we present vennAR, an augmented reality (AR) based immersive experience. We select Plot 6, Congtai Square, as our site in the city. Our design 'vennAR' is a 1600mm x 600mm x 1900mm (length, width, and height) vending machine for AR experience. This machine allows users to borrow or rent AR glasses using their Wechat QR codes. VennAR is designed to present four touch-based ultra-HD screens to users (two main, and two side screens). Users can touch to browse the internet to search for places to eat, drink, entertain, or visit interesting events in the city. With the preliminary knowledge of where to go and how to navigate, users can then checkout an AR glass. This glass helps them to navigate across the city aided by an immersive mixed-reality experience and with hand gestures as input to their interactions. With vennAR, we present one device and one database bsed user experience, which means users dont need their phone. All data sources are unified and visualized on the canvas of the 3D world of Handan. <br><br>

Apart from navigation/way-finding, users can also use vennAR to interact and engage with other people in the city. For example, they can participate in AR games playable at any plaza or any open outdoor public space by interacting with nearby users. Similarly, they can go for shared boat rides in the nearby Congtai park, where they can experience never seen before immersive experience that is visually stimulating, creative, and engaging. People using vennAR would love to spend extended time in the outdoor urban space, thereby enriching and activating the public realm.

On site, we placed a series of hour glasses, with a pedestrian walkway over the existing waterbody, to create a majestic experience for visitors. <br><br>

VAWT, Fish Scoop Effect Tech: <br>
Each hour glass accomodates a Vertical axis Wind turbine (also called VAWT, Darrieus type). These Vawt turbines are capable to generate electricity from the wind energy on-site, which is on average 6m/s. Each of these units are tall enough to generate 2285820 kWh from 8 turbines annually, enough to run 650 homes. VAWT has many advantages over horizontal axis turbines, including compactness, cheaper cost, and easier to install. 
A recent study by The Caltech Field Laboratory for Optimized Wind Energy (FLOWE) found that as VAWTs can be placed closer together, they're capable of generating ten times as much energy per square meter than horizontal axis turbines. The study also found that having each VAWT spin in the opposite direction of its neighbor allowed them to spin faster because the opposing spins reduced the drag on each turbine, which upped their efficiency even more. <br><br>

SOLAR DESALINATION, solar furnace:<br>
Adding to the above in each of the hour glass theres' a modified solar furnace installed at the bottom part of the sculpture. Unlike conventional solar furnace systems, we proposed to use recycled plastic-based (with much lower embodied energy) Fresnel lens (7m in diameter) at 30m height from ground to boil water in the base. This Fresnel lens reduces the amount of material required compared to a conventional lens by dividing the lens into a set of concentric annular sections. <br><br>

PV CELL TECHNOLOGY, integrated with Rawlemon Sphere's:<br>
From research, it looks like Copenhagen has great potential of PV Cell technology. But since our sculptural art form is resonating with each others' form in the group, especially the orientation of the top of the hour glass is angled at different degrees for each system, they do not allow enough leverage to harness efficient solar radiation. Furthermore, we captured solar energy by deploying a Rawlemon sphere, 6m in diameter on top of the structure, that housed PV cells on its surface. <br><br>",,urban-design,urban art

Our concept was to place the AC & non AC exhibition halls into separate zones, connected via an urban plaza. The AC building, was designed by placing the floor plates of the exhibition galleries offset from one another. This was a  novel approach in trade fair exhibition facilities as conventionally steel buildings of such programs are designed using a monotonous grid type arrangement, one floor placed above another. This design exemplified the extensive power of steel as a structural material with structural spans covering as long as 120m in length. The non AC halls were semi-open steel meshes, covered by FRP covering, placed on a contoured land, with landscape elements built with stainless steel. These included, lamp posts, signages, public seatings & display kiosks. <br><br>

The cantilevered floor arrangment was made possible by a structural system inspired from suspension bridges (spanning as long as 80m).  Further, the ground space that was left open (due to the suspended floors), was utilised by placing fire water reservoir, loading/unloading bay & other services.

It is a global magnet attracting ideas, talent, and investment motivated to improve peoples' lives. This is made possible by the exchange of ideas that includes people from diverse parts of the world with diverse experiences. Our design celebrates this notion of 'inclusivity', that is the life-blood of Silicon Valley. We present Pinnacle, a 185 ft high landmark structure built with light and durable carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites that provide a semi-shaded iconic space that is memorable and eventful. This structure represents inclusiveness, collaboration, and the notion of diversity that brings people together. Functionally it shades a sunken courtyard and a set of watchtowers. These spaces encourage people watching and public interaction. The watchtower allows users to experience the neighboring area of the site including the beautiful cityscape of San Jose from multiple levels (40 ft and 60 ft high). <br><br>

The sunken court is adjoined by green grass mounds that inhabit spaces such as cafes, restaurants, bars, libraries, and interactive communal rooms (40k sqft area). The green mounds are designed to encourage outdoor sports activities such as running, hiking, biking, etc. More importantly, the sunken court is carefully designed to create a natural barrier between the interaction space and the natural riparian habitat that adjoins the site. Furthermore, we place a thick vegetative cover as a green park between the Guadalupe River and the sunken court to obstruct glare from artificial light at night. Our lighting design strategy places two kinds of light. The first is a LED strip channel lighting carefully encased in a carbon fiber reinforced polymer channel at the top of the Pinnacle. This design creates a continuous blue light source for diffused lighting at night, reducing glare and visual disturbance to the birds, insects, fishes, etc. The second light source is the LED spot lights placed on ground that is shielded by metal protectors and by the sunken courtyard's design. These lighting techniques allow the proposed space to be activated 18 hours a day and 7 days a week.

The site given was in midtown Atlanta, USA, where we proposed to redevelop it as an entertainment district which will be active 18 hours a day and 7 days of the week. We also proposed a collection of mixed use programs including, offices, high-end residences, affordable housing, retail spaces, banks, bars, shops, malls, cinemas and movie theater areas. <br><br>

In theatre and film, the screen forms an imaginary fourth wall, separating the audience from the action within the fictitious world.  Just as innovative thespians have broken the fourth wall to engage directly with their audience, the Stage Street design would break the fourth wall of Atlanta culture by blurring the boundaries of public and private spaces and inviting users to engage in a shared life. Elements such as plazas, balconies, rooftops, outdoor dining, a linear park, and event spaces create stages to see and be seen. Special attention was given to the ground floor of buildings, using a continuous street wall, facade transparency, activation, detailing, and variation to create an inviting pedestrian environment. The design uniquely blended entertainment industry, culture, and social spaces to create a dynamic, mixed-use development. <br><br>

The design was formulated from a parametric module, design and developed in Autodesk's Maya software. Spatial arrangements were composed by intelligent juxtapostions and connections of a base parametric module. This gave rise to multiple design expressions alongwith volume enclosure possbilities that was able to accomodate one bedroom to duplex four bedroom units. Some modules supported a combination of inclined and flat floors. Flat floors were used for formal areas like living, bedroom, etc , while the inclined floors were used to house informal areas like gathering spaces, children play areas etc. Also, each of the unit had a roof garden that helped integrate the landscape into the building.

To maintain social hygiene, parents had to manage kids and at the same time had to work from home with the same diligence, as they would in an office setting. This created havoc for tele working parents with child-care responsibilities. In these testing times, we hypothesize that having a comfortable furniture, that addresses the need of caregiving and work will improve efficiency in parenting and ease in working from home ensuring increasing productivity. Owing to the need of a new working space, we present 'The Womb', a work desk that comes with added toddlers space where they can live and play. In this space, parents can place a crib for new born babies, or they can use it as a play area for kids between the age 1-5 years. This furniture allows parents to peacefully focus on work, while keeping a protective eye on their kids. Currently, lacking such a furniture, parents either have to sit on their computer with their kids or they make to and fro trips between their workplace and their designated kids area. We envision with 'The Womb', parents can better focus on work, while they know there kids are safe and secure, right next to them.  <br><br>

The furniture is of size 1775 mm x 1810 mm x 1700 mm (length, width, and height) making it a compact unit that can be placed in a living space or in a bedroom. In addition, the design accommodates ample flexibility in terms of visual and physical connection to allow kids privacy and the right set of parental care. For example, it comes with a removable fence to ensure kids stay at the toddlers' area. In addition, the work desk can be folded to allow increase in work space, or increase in visual connectivity to the toddlers' area (that also creates more open space for kids). Similarly, it is designed with vertical and horizontal louvers that creates an enclosure (which kids love), yet provides a visual connection to them such that parents can ensure they are safe and well protected.",https://youtu.be/COBKE7qShXQ,design,furniture design

 Embrace Zero, is an exemplary reflection to improve human life by providing an urban realm which ensures, community engagement, public interaction and an opportunity to seek and provide for everyone. Respecting the local guidelines of NC2-P40 zone, the proposed mixed use development employs public functions at the ground level, including street facing restaurants, cafes, and groceries, educational spaces including library, maker spaces and vocational training facilities. It provides bike storages encouraging biking around the neighborhood. Upper levels are revitalized by providing strategically located sky gardens and cantilevered semi sheltered spaces to enrich a diverse and intriguing spatial experience. <br><br>

DESIGN<br>
The upper blocks are up to 5 level high, composed of community spaces and residential apartments including studio (465 sqft), one bedroom (650 sqft) and two bedroom (900 sqft) apartments.  They are designed to be compact and efficient, encouraging residents to spend leisure time outside with each other in the neighborhood. Reducing apartment size also ensures lower price range for the units, making it affordable for a larger population of the city. All living units allow natural ventilation by eliminating traditional double loaded corridor plan and introducing semi-open single loaded corridor system with operable screens. Operable windows on opposing sides of the unit allow free cross flow of air. The blocks maximize southern exposure to gain maximum passive solar gain and day lighting by orienting to the south and strategically stepping down for continued exposure. 
The envelope is tightly sealed and well-insulated, and thermal bridging is minimized. External vertical shutters across west and southern facade are opened during cool weather to take advantage of passive solar heat gains, and are closed during warmer weather, providing resident engagement and control while eliminating the need for a cooling system. <br><br>
 
ENERGY<br>
 The PV arrays overhang the building to maximize the electricity generation. PV cells are covered in polychromatic glass laminate, which is highly efficient to capture and distribute daylight into covered courts. Hot water and space heating is ensured through a ground-source heat pump. Floors are heated and cooled via in-slab radiant conditioning supplied by heat pumps for increased occupant comfort. Leveraging high rainfall potential of the region, a rain water cistern of size 30 000 cubic feet is provided underneath the community garden to allow grey water reuse. We used nail laminated timber as the structural frame considering its best environmental performance with respect to global warming, environment acidification, ozone depletion, smog creation etc.<br><br>",,architecture,ecological design
