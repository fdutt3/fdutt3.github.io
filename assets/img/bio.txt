Caddisflai 
is a design and technology studio that is motivated to make peoples' lives better through the use of innovative design thinking and state of the art technology. In that we are proud to adopt a biomimetic design approach, where we are inspired by natural systems such as plants, animals, birds or insects to understand how complex problems can be addressed with sustainable solutions. 
We fuse the power of generative design and artificial intelligence with years of on-site design expertise to solve day-to-day problems in built environments, urban spaces, products that we use, and virtual systems that we interface with. Using rapid manufacturing technologies in digital fabrication like 3D printing, metal casting, sensor prototyping, and through writing custom software to generate endless design variations that we simulate, test, and validate to select optimal solutions to urban problems. As we are inspired from complex systems in nature, we simulate biological systems, applying generative neural network modeling to parse design queues from our ecosystem. 





work have been recognized in a growing list of renowned journals and publications, including IEEE-VIS, CHI, KDD, Acadia, Simaud, Caadria, Ecaade, Ijac and many others. Our contribution to the design space has consistently won numerous international design competitions and other merits. We strive to continue adopting biomimetic design thinking to develop design solutions that are meant to last and cause no harm.
